# company-home-page-flexbox

## Objective

Create a company web page using Flexbox to layout elements.

## Method

### Styling

Background is a simple off-white colour using hex values. I've only used a
single font (Poppins) throughout for headings, sub-headings and text. I could
improve the overall styling by possibly using a different font and font colour
for paragraph text. I've tried to keep the text consistent throughout by using
relative sizing.

Images were taken from unsplash and I need to go back into the project and
attribute each one to its creator.

Margins and paddings are largely by eye and again I've tried to keep
consistent by setting these globally for each section / element.

### Layout

I've only used basic Flexbox properties for layout such as spacing for the logo
and navigation bar and other key elements such as images.

flex-wrap and flex-direction were used to organise elements as the page shrank
and grew. I haven't used flex-shrink / flex-grow and need to revisit these
to understand how they could be used in this example.

The layout has largely worked but I couldn't get the menu items to wrap correctly so
ended up using a media query to show an hamburger menu image. I will need to
revisit and see how I can improve here. Also will need to look into creating a
proper hamburger menu but this appears to use javaScript and I'm not at that
stage yet.

## Learnings

For me the most difficult part were the design and visual elements:-

- **Colours and fonts**:- Blending elements with background colour.
- **Margins and paddings**:- Ensuring they add to the visual impact.
- **Images**:- Sizing (both visual and file size)

Layout was relatively easy with Flexbox but again with practice this could get
better, especially the use of other Flexbox properties such as shrink and grow.
